### Introduction
Hey! I'm Andy Young, a second year Computer Engineering major from Honolulu, Hawaii! I've been programming as a hobby since my freshman year of high school and am lucky to have gained a lot of software and web development experiences and skills as a result. I'm very grateful to be able to pursue my passion as a career and solve all interesting problems the field has to offer.

### Projects
Since there are requirements I have to fill for this assignment, I figured I could just include a few of my projects to knock some of the Markdown stuff down:
- [Tory Roofing](https://torystimesheet.com/)
  - Automated and digitized Tory Roofingâ€™s employee/job management system and payroll process by developing a webapp using **Ruby on Rails** that allows foreman to submit timesheets on an intuitive mobile UI and managers to review and automatically perform the payroll every week.
- [OP.GG Search](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/opgg-summoner-search/dfnoddgekoeiljeaekobnchnedoipgpc?hl=en)
   - Created a Chrome extension with **JavaScript** as a freshman in high school, which currently has 5000+ users, that adds extra features to a League of Legends statistics website.

### Hawaii Food
Enough with the programming stuff, here are my top 5 favorite places to eat in Hawaii (this list changes frequently):
1. *Off the Hook* (Poke)
2. *Kam Bowl* (Oxtail Soup)
3. *Mitch's Fish Market* (Sashimi, Obama Approved)
4. *Giovanni's Shrimp Truck*
5. ~~*Waiola Shave Ice*~~ *Matsumoto Shave Ice*
